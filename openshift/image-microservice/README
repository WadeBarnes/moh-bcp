# Readme

Image microservice should be moved to a separate repo once mature.


## Notes


### Options:

* Puppetteer - share styles and some markup (wouldn't include angular app, just enough styles for page)
    Pro: easier to edit, uses overlapping technology (any angular dev could jump in and make tweaks)
    Con: harder to setup puppeteer
    todo - look at ability to strip all styles from current review page and pull it down




### Estimate

    - Template setup - 4 days
    - RESTful interface - 2 day
        - requires image upload for signature
    - Image generation - 1 day
    - OpenShift config / depoyment - 3 days



#### Features / design


    {
        templateVersion: "1",
        header: "Application for Medical Services Plan",
        confirmationMessage: "blah"
        confirmationIconType: "lorem"
        confirmationStatus: "success" | "warning"
    }
